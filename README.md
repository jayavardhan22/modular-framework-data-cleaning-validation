# 🚦 Traffic Collision Data Quality Validation

## Hybrid Rule-Based & Machine Learning Framework

🔹 **MSc Data Analytics – Applied Research Project**  
🔹 **Production-style data quality validation pipeline**

---

## 🔍 Problem

Real-world traffic collision datasets often contain:

- Missing or invalid coordinates
- Duplicate records
- Logical inconsistencies in casualty counts
- Irregular spatial and numerical patterns

These issues reduce trust in analytics, dashboards, and ML models.

---

## 💡 Solution

A **modular, explainable data quality validation framework** that combines:

- 🧱 **Schema validation** (structure & data types)
- ✅ **Rule-based checks** (deterministic, auditable)
- 🤖 **Unsupervised anomaly detection** (pattern-based)

Designed to **scale**, **reduce manual preprocessing**, and **preserve data integrity**.

## 🤖 Models Used

- **Isolation Forest** – primary anomaly detector
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** – local density anomalies
- **DBSCAN** – spatial density anomalies
- **Random Forest** – benchmark only

---

## 📊 Key Results

**Isolation Forest**

- Precision: **88.5%**
- Recall: **83.7%**
- F1-Score: **86.0%**
- Error Detection Rate: **82.4%**

✔ High anomaly coverage  
✔ Strong interpretability  
✔ Reduced manual data cleaning
